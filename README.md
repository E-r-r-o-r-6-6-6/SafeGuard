# Some words from the Developer

Hii it is just my first project in java lang . Well it is also my first app and after 3 month of working , here is its beta version **1.0Beta**. it may be full of error , coz we know Error is the best teacher for a programer .

 ok let's see a brief introduction on it.

 # Introduction

 ## What is SafeGuard ?
>In single sentence

  ***SafeGuard*** is a totally **offline assistant** app that can detect some ***SOS Signal*** and can do some predefined work to deal with that situation.
  
  Well i made this app specialy for **protect female**. We all know that girls/women are really not safe at this time.There are many cruel criminals outside home.Thus this app is in under Development it may arise many bugs and errors. You can report that by the in app **Report** button or you may contact me on this email (error368280@gmail.com) and report problem so that we can make the app better for decrease a little amount of the rate of crime.

  Actually i forgot to say **"why this app is necessary?"**. Actually people can call 112 at the emergency situation but there are many examples of the situation where the victim doesn't have the time to open his/her phone and call the emergency number. They are busy by either running from the criminal or by dealing with that painful situations. Didn't they can survive if atleast his/her family or friends (whom they trust) was informed that there might be something wrong with their close one ? In my opinion yes it must be. See , in this situation they must atleast call to the person who may be in problem and confirm is everything all right!! Actually here how my app works ðŸ˜… 

  Before we know how to use it or how it works , lets know some features that my app have.

**features**
>1) Shake detection
>2) Voice command


 **How it works ?**

  My app has a **continuously Listening function** so In a SOS situation the user can give some predefined voice commands or shake the device that give signal to the app that *"User is in problem , we must help her"*. By doing this a overlay pop-up will be display to confirm is it accidentally or not. If the user doesn't give any response to it in 30 seconds, it will trigger its SOS mode.
    In future i will also add some other way to detect the signal and also improve this app as better i can. Below i have put some important note to use my app.

   ## **IMPORTANT**
1) I told that this app is under development and has a continuously listening funtion and also offline , it gonna process all the data in your device . So it can use cpu and battery too much.So when you feel safe and generaly when you at home or any other safe place stop the service from app. (App>Home>Stop Button)
2) Start the service only when you feel unsafe . It may not gonna hang your phone but it may take much battery. But you can keep the service ON always if you want . But highly recommend to turn ON the servie before leave home (generaly at night).
3) Sometime it may detect false things so when your device vibrate , it show a confirmation window . Remember to check it.

## **NOTE**
Since due to privacy , Android restrict Background mic access so the continuous listen function may misbehave or sometimes it may stop listening . In this case other trigger signal will work so I recommend you to use the shake function and other functiions (i will add soon). If you are using ***MIUI/Xiaomi phone*** , there is high chance that it will restict my voice trigger method. Sorry for that. But i am trying to fix this as soon as possible.
       There is a high chance for monthly update . Thus i didn't add any update alert method so pls check this site for update the app. Soon i will upload it in Google play store (if i got the permission).Later you can update from there.

       Atlast my last word is , **STAY SAFE , STAY HAPPY , LIVE LIFE WITH JOY AND ENJOY YOUR FREEDOM**
                                                                                               **~ERROR**
